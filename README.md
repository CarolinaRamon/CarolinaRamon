### Hi there 👋

I'm an English teacher and translator, but for the last two years I have been learning how to code. I'm currently studying Applied Information Technology at UTN-INSPT. I'm very happy to have discovered a passion in programming! What I ❤ the most is to have an idea and bring it to life through coding ⚡.
Thanks for stopping by!

Carolina
